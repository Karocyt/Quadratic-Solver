# Quadratic-Solver
A basic command-line tool to solve simple linear and quadratic equations

# Setup
The only dependancy would be `argparse`:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run
```bash
./quadratic_solver "1x + 3x^2 = 5 + x"
```

A `-v` (verbose) option is available to show major steps.
